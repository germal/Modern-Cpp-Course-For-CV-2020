# A: Using the terminal(4 points)

This exercise focuses on using the terminal efficiently.
Every question in this exercise must be answered with a command on a single line. You should save each of these lines into
the file homework_1/task_1/commands.sh.

Make sure all commands run from within homework_1/task_1/folder correctly.

1. **(1 points)** Count how many lines are there in “data.dat”.
2. **(1 points)** Count how many lines of those contain “dolor” or “dalor”?
3. **(1 points)** Count how many words are there in “data.dat”?
4. **(1 points)** Count how many of those start with “mol”?

_Hint:_ you might want to use wc command.

# B: Build System(6 points)

All the documentation for this exercise is in the cpp-homeworks/homework_1/task_2/README.md file. You should cd into the
task directory, open a text editor, and start working.
Basically the output of your exercise should be:

5. **(2 points)** A build script, build.sh, that allows to build the library and the example program within the exercise
    directory. So, basically leave this script on cpp-homeworks/homework_1/task_2/build.sh
6. **(2 points)** The same holds true for the installation script install.sh
7. **(2 points)** And the CMakeLists.txt files
